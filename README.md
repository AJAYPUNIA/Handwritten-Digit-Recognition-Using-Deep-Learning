# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. A Neural Network (MLP) is trained for high accuracy using data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model.
